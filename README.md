## Flare-Watch-App

Real-Time Inflammation Management App
A mobile app paired with a discreet wearable patch that continuously monitors inflammation biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, calprotectin) in sweat and delivers personalized dietary recommendations in real time. By translating biochemical feedback into actionable guidance, users can make smarter food and lifestyle choices before symptoms flare. 


## Why It Matters
Traditional methods for tracking inflammation—blood tests or symptom logs—are invasive, slow, and disconnected from daily life. Sweat Sensor fills this gap by providing non-intrusive, instant insights, helping individuals with chronic conditions (arthritis, IBS, heart disease) adjust their nutrition and habits as they go. 


## Key Features

Wearable Patch: Samples sweat hourly, measures biomarkers, and sends encrypted data via Bluetooth.
